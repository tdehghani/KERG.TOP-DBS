=======================================
 Top-DBS can be downloaded from "http://kerg.um.ac.ir/"

 In order to run Top-DBS the following information must be provided:
 1. Secondary structure information (beta-strands and beta-residue)  
 2. A beta-residue contact score matrix 
 3. A beta-strand pairwise alignment matrix

 The program will provide in output the following information:
 1. Beta-strand pairs
 2. Beta-strand pairing direction
 3. Beta-sheet topology
 
 ***Examples files contained in the example folder.
=======================================
 Installation (Windows Version):
 1. Unzip Top-DBS.rar
 2. Input file:
    a Beta-strand pairwise alignment matrix [example\1nega\1nega.txt] 
 3. Build and Run Top-DBS.exe 
 4. Output file:
    Beta-sheet topology [example\1nega\1nega.out]
 ***Correct answer is provided in following address:
    [example\1nega\1nega.str]
 Enjoy it!
